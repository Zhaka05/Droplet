# 💧 Droplet

A real-time water waste tracking app paired with a custom Arduino drain sensor. Droplet measures how much water goes down the drain during each use, tracks it against a daily limit, and alerts you when you've been running water too long.

---

## How It Works

A cylindrical sensor sits in the drain. Three conductivity probes are arranged in a triangle formation. When water bridges the probes, the circuit completes and the app starts tracking.

| Active Probes | Flow Level | Flow Rate |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Low | 0.5 GPM |
| 2 | Medium | 1.5 GPM |
| 3 | High | 2.2 GPM |

After **60 seconds** of continuous flow, a buzzer fires on the hardware (pin D8) and the app shows a full-screen alert.

## Architecture

```
Arduino Uno
    │  USB Serial (JSON events)
    ▼
serial_bridge.py          ← Python — reads serial, POSTs to backend
    │  HTTP POST /api/sensor/event
    ▼
backend/main.py           ← FastAPI — receives events, broadcasts via WebSocket
    │  WebSocket ws://localhost:8000/ws
    ▼
React App (Vite)          ← UI — live updates, session history, daily limit
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- Arduino Uno with the Droplet sensor sketch uploaded

---

### 1. Install dependencies

**React app:**
```bash
npm install
```

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Serial bridge:**
```bash
pip install requests pyserial
```

---

### 2. Find your Arduino port

```bash
python -m serial.tools.list_ports --verbose
```

Look for `Arduino Uno (COMx)` and note the port. Update line 12 of `serial_bridge.py`:

```python
SERIAL_PORT = "COM4"   # your port here
```

---

### 3. Run everything

Open **four terminals**, each in the project root:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — React app
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Backend
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload

# Terminal 3 — Serial bridge (Arduino must be connected)
python serial_bridge.py

# Terminal 4 — open the app
# Visit http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Testing

### End-to-end (Playwright)

Specs are in `e2e/`. They run the app in a real browser. Playwright can start the Vite dev server for you; see `playwright.config.js`. If you already have `npm run dev` on port 5173, a local run may reuse that process when the `CI` environment variable is not set.

From the **project root** (after `npm install`):

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

Use `npm run test:e2e:ui` for Playwright’s interactive UI. Flows that only use client-side state (for example, the daily limit) do not require the Python backend to be running.

The Playwright `webServer` uses `VITE_WS_URL` (a port with no server) and `VITE_BUZZER_THRESHOLD=3` so the Devices simulator stays available and the water-waste alert does not need a 60-second wait. If you reuse a manually started `npm run dev` (no `CI`), point it at the same env vars or let Playwright start Vite so e2e stays consistent.

### Backend (pytest)

API and WebSocket tests use pytest from the `backend` folder:

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

(Requires the same `pip install -r requirements.txt` as the backend above.)

## App Pages

### Home
Live total household waste for the day, daily limit progress with an animated water fill graphic, and a recent sessions log with time, duration, flow level, and gallons.

### Limit
Set a custom daily water waste limit in gallons. Choose from preset templates (Eco Warrior, Family of 4, Short Showers, etc.) or enter your own value. Progress bar turns orange at 80% and red when exceeded.

### Devices
View all connected sensors with live/connecting status. The probe configuration panel shows the triangle layout and lights up probes in real time. When the real sensor is disconnected, a built-in simulator lets you test all flow levels. Add new devices or edit/delete existing ones.

### Profile
Edit your name and avatar. View lifetime stats — total sessions, gallons wasted, average per session, and longest session. Manage notification preferences.

## Arduino Serial Protocol

The Arduino sends newline-delimited JSON over serial at 9600 baud:

```json
{ "event": "start" }
{ "event": "update", "duration_seconds": 5, "probes_active": 2, "flow_level": "medium", "flow_rate_gpm": 1.5, "gallons": 0.125 }
{ "event": "stop",   "duration_seconds": 12, "probes_active": 0, "flow_level": "none",   "flow_rate_gpm": 0.0, "gallons": 0.244 }
```
